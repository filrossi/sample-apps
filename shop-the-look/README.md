In order to deploy the full Shop The Look sample app, you need to setup the following services. Shop The Look ***will not work*** without these services. 

<details>
<summary>
<h4>Google Cloud Setup</h4>
</summary>

Google Cloud setup allows you to use Vertex AI, a machine learning platform that allows you to embed your images and videos using Google's Multimodal Embedding Model. This will also allow you to upload your images and videos to Google Cloud Storage.

1. Create a new project in the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).

2. Enable the following APIs for your project:
   - Vertex AI API
   - Cloud Storage API

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5116b69b-8eb8-4fc8-bba6-883d144a3b03)

5. Encode the JSON key file to base64:
   ```bash
   base64 -i path/to/your-key-file.json | tr -d '\n' > google-credentials-base64.txt
   ```

6. Save the base64-encoded key, we will be using this in the [Environment Variables](#environment-variables) section. 

7. *Optional:* To run the Google Cloud Vertex AI SDK locally (for testing purposes), follow the gcloud CLI authentication setup instructions [here](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/embeddings/get-multimodal-embeddings#prereqs). 
</details>

<details>
<summary>
<h4>Pinecone Setup</h4>
</summary>

This step allows you to use Pinecone Serverless, our very own serverless vector database service, to upsert the multimodal embeddings to Pinecone.

1. Sign up for a [Pinecone account](https://www.pinecone.io/?utm_source=shop-the-look&utm_medium=referral).
2. Create a new Pinecone Serverless Index with the following settings:
   1. Dimensions: `1408` (for Google's Multimodal Embedding Model)
   2. Metric: `cosine`
   3. Choose your cloud provider of choice
   4. Choose your region of choice
  
   ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3eb70b3c-cacd-404f-8b2f-64db8f6a5846)

3. Note down your Pinecone API key, you will need this to connect to your Pinecone index.

9. Redeploy your project to apply the environment variables.

10. Your Shop The Look application should now be redeployed and accessible, but without assets.

11. Upload your own images and videos. Follow the instructions in the next section. 

## üåâ Use Your Own Images and Videos (20 minutes)

In order to make Shop The Look your own, you need to **upload your own images and videos**. 

Open the [Image and Video Embedding Processors](https://github.com/pinecone-io/sample-apps/blob/main/shop-the-look/scripts/README.md) guide (located at [`scripts/README.md`](https://github.com/pinecone-io/sample-apps/blob/main/shop-the-look/scripts/README.md)) and follow the instructions. 

## ü´† Troubleshooting

For **Google Cloud** authentication or permission issues, ensure that:
- The service account has the correct permissions - `Vertex AI User`, `Storage Object Viewer`
- The `GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS_BASE64` environment variable is correctly set, double check in your shell or Vercel environment variables. 
- The environment variables are set. Save the environment variables to your shell configuration file (`.bashrc`, `.zshrc`, or any other `rc` file you use), or set these environment variables manually in [your shell](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-read-and-set-environmental-and-shell-variables-on-linux).
- The Google Cloud APIs are enabled for your project - `Vertex AI API`, `Cloud Storage API`
- Make sure you have [setup Google Authentication for Shop The Look](https://github.com/pinecone-io/sample-apps-internal/blob/main/shop-the-look/README.md#google-cloud-setup) correctly
- [Official Google Cloud Authentication Guide](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/getting-started)

For **Pinecone** issues, verify that:
- You entered the right Index name
- Your API key is correct
- The Index is created with the correct dimensions (1408)
- The environment variables are set. Save the environment variables to your shell configuration file (`.bashrc`, `.zshrc`, or any other `rc` file you use), or set these environment variables manually in [your shell](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-read-and-set-environmental-and-shell-variables-on-linux).
- Make sure you have [setup Pinecone for Shop The Look](https://github.com/pinecone-io/sample-apps-internal/blob/main/shop-the-look/README.md#pinecone-setup) correctly
- [Official Pinecone Documentation](https://www.pinecone.io/docs?utm_source=shop-the-look&utm_medium=referral)

For **Vercel** deployment issues, check:
- [Vercel build logs](https://vercel.com/docs/deployments/logs)
- Ensure all [environment variables](https://vercel.com/docs/projects/environment-variables) are correctly set in the Vercel project settings
- Ensure you set your project's **Settings** -> **Root Directory** to use `shop-the-look`, otherwise it would try to deploy the entire Sample App monorepo which would fail

For **other** issues, please create an issue in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/pinecone-io/sample-apps/issues).

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Service Limitations

There are some service limitations to be aware of. 

#### Affects Frontend
- Vercel's request body size limit of 4.5 MB, so all image and video uploads in the frontend (this is the drag-and-drop upload and upload button) is limited to <4.5 MB ([source](https://vercel.com/docs/storage/vercel-blob/server-upload)). Users will not be able to upload images or videos larger than 4.5 MB in Shop The Look. To alleviate this, we apply client-side image compression to images prior to uploading. Videos are not compressed. 

#### Affects Backend
- Multimodal Embedding Model using videos hosted on Google Cloud Storage has no maximum video length, but only 2 minutes of content will be analyzed at a time ([source](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/embeddings/get-multimodal-embeddings#api-limits)) 
- Multimodal Embedding Model image upload is limited to 20 MB, and the image is resized to 512x512 pixels prior to embedding ([source](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/embeddings/get-multimodal-embeddings#api-limits))
- Some users may encounter authentication issues with the Google Cloud SDK when getting embeddings for videos stored in Google Cloud Storage using `gs://` URIs. These issues will appear as `StatusCode.UNAUTHENTICATED` and `Video embedding failed with the following error: Deadline` errors. This is a known issue with the Google Cloud SDK, and a potential solution can be found in this [Stack Overflow thread](https://stackoverflow.com/a/78618078/1913389). If this does not fix your issue, you will need to provide the video as a base64-encoded byte string (`video.bytesBase64Encoded`) - further instructions found [here](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/embeddings/get-multimodal-embeddings#vid-embedding).
- Multimodal Embedding Model base64-encoded string video upload is limited to 27,000,000 chars ([not documented](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/embeddings/get-multimodal-embeddings#api-limits), but you will error) 
- Vercel Python Serverless Functions cannot exceed 250 MB in size ([source](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/limitations#vercel-functions-limitations)), so if you use a large Python library like `vertex-ai`, you will error. You will need to query Vertex AI's REST API directly, like in [/api/v1/endpoints](https://github.com/pinecone-io/sample-apps/tree/main/shop-the-look/api/v1/endpoints)
- When extending the FastAPI backend, requests need to be mapped to `/api/:path*/` as this uses `next.config.js` rewrites. More information in the [Next.js FastAPI](https://github.com/digitros/nextjs-fastapi) Starter from Vercel. ([source](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/limitations#vercel-functions-limitations))
